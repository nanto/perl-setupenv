pmbundler
~~~~~~~~~

* Options

Maybe you want to set PMBUNDLER_REPO_URL, in your Makefile or
command-line argument, to a git repository URL which contains the
tarballs for the local Perl module repository, such that the local
repository directory can be shared among hosts:

  PMBUNDLER_REPO_URL = git://your.git.repo.example/path/to/pm-mirror.git

* Rules

  $ make pmbundler-install

Install modules listed in carton.lock to the temporary directory
(local/pmbuilder/install) to obtain their tarballs.  Tarballs will be
placed at appropriate location in the repository directory
(local/pmbuilder/mirror).

  $ make pmbundler-install-module \
        PMBUNDLER_INSTALL_MODULE="Module::1 Module::2"

Install the modules specified in the argument to the temporary
directory (local/pmbuilder/install) to obtain their tarballs.
Tarballs will be placed at appropriate location in the repository
directory (local/pmbuilder/mirror).

  $ make pmbundler-repo-update

Update the Perl module repository directory, using PMBUNDLER_REPO_URL
if specified.  This rule should be executed before other rules using
Perl module installation, such as C<make carton-instal>, is executed.
